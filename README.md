# RideshareArcade
RPI 3 Super Nintendo / Vertical Scrolling Shooter project for entertaining your rideshare clients


## The Idea

The year is 2018. The setting is Downtown Denver, as the sun set on yet another beautiful August day in Colorado. The birds were chirping, the bunnies were frolicking around the last remaining plot of undeveloped land in Denver and, as fate would have it, not a surge price in sight. As I wheeled around town picking up clients in Dori, my Cobalt Blue Ford Focus, I began to ponder ways to increase my rideshare revenue, and to be more efficient with my time spent on the grind.  

I tumbled around a few ideas- complementary water and gum, paid vending, letting the passenger control the Spotify, etc, but ultimately landed on SNES/Vertical Scrolling Shoot'em Up arcade for the back seat.

Now I'll show you how I did it, for under $100. 


## Bill of Materials

1x Raspberry Pi 3
1x Computer Monitor w/ Sound + HDMI Port
1x HDMI Cable + Power Cable for Monitor & RPI3
1x SD Card (A good one- You will need it for running SNES)
1x 16GB+ USB Stick
1x DC Power Converter (You will be plugging Monitor & RPI3 into it, so be sure to get one that works with your power cords)
2x SNES Controllers (Amazon to the rescue)
1x An Afternoon 
8x Beer (optional)


## Software Needed Ahead of Time

SD Card Formatter (for a clean SD card overwrite and format)

BalenaEtcher (for writing Raspbian OS)


## Analytics & Experiments

This was pretty straightforward- I simply measured my tip earnings for the preceeding 2 months, divided by total rides given, and returned a number. I did the same for the first two months of having the arcade operational. The result was an increase in my total tips by a whopping 220%! ($2 increase to amlost $4.50 avg tip per ride)

## Customer Feedback

The overarching reaction was phenomenal. I ended up with 99, 5-star reviews, and 1, 4-star review. What I learned from my 4-star reviewer, was that some people didn't really care for the arcade, and noted the controllers made the car "messy."

I just started putting them in the seatback pockets after each ride. Problemo, solvedo.
